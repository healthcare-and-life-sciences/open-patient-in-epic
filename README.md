<h1>A-HLS Open Patient in Epic Documentation </h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

The Open Patient in Epic Accelerator enables the user to open a patient’s record in the Epic EHR system from an OmniScript component in Health Cloud, with user-specified context (e.g., Scheduling, Refill). 

The Accelerator pre-populates parameters and the url suffix for the Epic API “Receive Communication” as documented here on open.epic.com (http://open.epic.com/): https://open.epic.com/Operational/ContactCenter.

The Accelerator gives the user a choice of context for which to view the patient in Epic. By default, the contexts included are:

* Scheduling
* Medication Refill
* Nurse Triage
* Member Services
* Log Phone Call
* (Pre-selected by default) Default Patient Context - this represents a blank context which will trigger a default documentation activity configured by the organization.

1. A customer has licenses for Health Cloud, and the HINS Managed Package with OmniStudio. These solutions have all been installed and are functional.
2. A customer is assuming Salesforce Lightning Experience — not Classic.
3. Data Model elements that are part of the HINS (Vlocity) Managed package and Health Cloud are all available.
4. The Accelerator uses the Lightning Design System standards and look. Customers may want to apply their own branding which can be achieved.
5. A customer is live on Epic and has appropriate administrator resources to complete any required Epic configuration.
