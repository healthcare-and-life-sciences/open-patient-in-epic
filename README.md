<h1>A-HLS Open Patient in Epic Documentation </h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

The Open Patient in Epic Accelerator enables the user to open a patient’s record in the Epic EHR system from an OmniScript component in Health Cloud, with user-specified context (e.g., Scheduling, Refill). 

The Accelerator pre-populates parameters and the url suffix for the Epic API “Receive Communication” as documented here on open.epic.com (http://open.epic.com/): https://open.epic.com/Operational/ContactCenter.

The Accelerator gives the user a choice of context for which to view the patient in Epic. By default, the contexts included are:

* Scheduling
* Medication Refill
* Nurse Triage
* Member Services
* Log Phone Call
* (Pre-selected by default) Default Patient Context - this represents a blank context which will trigger a default documentation activity configured by the organization.
